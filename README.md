# 🐍 Snake, Water, Gun - Python Game

Welcome to my first Python project! This is a simple terminal-based game where you can play **Snake, Water, Gun** against the computer. It's similar to Rock, Paper, Scissors but with a fun twist!

## 🎮 Game Rules

- Snake 🐍 drinks Water 💧 → Snake wins
- Water 💧 drowns Gun 🔫 → Water wins
- Gun 🔫 kills Snake 🐍 → Gun wins
- Same choices → It's a draw!

## 🧠 How it Works

- The computer randomly picks one option: Snake, Water, or Gun.
- You enter your choice by typing:
  - `s` for Snake
  - `w` for Water
  - `g` for Gun
- The winner is then decided based on the rules above.
